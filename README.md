# False_Alarm_Rate1

Overview - 


Documentation - 

First task is to move a lightcurve by 100 seconds and compare the 2 lightcurves. We can then see how many coincident crossings of certain thresholds take place.


Yet to do:
Task 1 - in the FAR_CZTI repo:
Synthetic orbits are expected to be shifted orbits, shift each quadrant by 100s and now you have new set of 4 lcs. (Would get shorter by 300s)
Use quad_cleans

Done?
Task 2 - in FAR1 repo:
Script should be able to take any quad_cleans and pass it into the pipeline. Use sigma from cift code as it is currently as the pipeline. Find all possible relevant stats.
Maintain histogram of the lightcurves as well if possible. Hist of how often a certain number of counts appears.
Do good plotting
Use different binnings


Questions - Make the FAR plot for multiple orbits. 
What other stats are relevant waise? How does FAR change with different binnings?
What does it mean statistically?
